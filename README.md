## üì¶ Installation

### DevTools Desktop Application (macOS)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: The desktop app has currently only been tested on Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3).
> If you encounter issues on Intel-based Macs, please [open an issue](https://github.com/LovesWorking/rn-better-dev-tools/issues)
> and we'll work together to fix it.

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/LovesWorking/rn-better-dev-tools/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Move the app to your Applications folder
4. Launch the app

### React Application Integration

The easiest way to connect your React application to the DevTools is by installing the npm package:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save-dev react-query-external-sync socket.io-client
npm install expo-device  # For automatic device detection

# Using yarn
yarn add -D react-query-external-sync socket.io-client
yarn add expo-device  # For automatic device detection

# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm add -D react-query-external-sync socket.io-client
pnpm add expo-device  # For automatic device detection
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Download and launch the React Native DevTools application
2. Add the hook to your application where you set up your React Query context:

```jsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { useSyncQueriesExternal } from "react-query-external-sync";
// Import Platform for React Native or use other platform detection for web/desktop
import { Platform } from "react-native";
import AsyncStorage from "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage";
import * as SecureStore from "expo-secure-store";
import * as ExpoDevice from "expo-device";
import { storage } from "./mmkv"; // Your MMKV instance

// Create your query client
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <AppContent />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}

function AppContent() {
  // Set up the sync hook - automatically disabled in production!
  useSyncQueriesExternal({
    queryClient,
    socketURL: "http://localhost:42831", // Default port for React Native DevTools
    deviceName: Platform?.OS || "web", // Platform detection
    platform: Platform?.OS || "web", // Use appropriate platform identifier
    deviceId: Platform?.OS || "web", // Use a PERSISTENT identifier (see note below)
    isDevice: ExpoDevice.isDevice, // Automatically detects real devices vs emulators
    extraDeviceInfo: {
      // Optional additional info about your device
      appVersion: "1.0.0",
      // Add any relevant platform info
    },
    enableLogs: false,
    envVariables: {
      NODE_ENV: process.env.NODE_ENV,
      // Add any private environment variables you want to monitor
      // Public environment variables are automatically loaded
    },
    // Storage monitoring with CRUD operations
    mmkvStorage: storage, // MMKV storage for ['#storage', 'mmkv', 'key'] queries + monitoring
    asyncStorage: AsyncStorage, // AsyncStorage for ['#storage', 'async', 'key'] queries + monitoring
    secureStorage: SecureStore, // SecureStore for ['#storage', 'secure', 'key'] queries + monitoring
    secureStorageKeys: [
      "userToken",
      "refreshToken",
      "biometricKey",
      "deviceId",
    ], // SecureStore keys to monitor
  });

  // Your app content
  return <YourApp />;
}
```

3. Start your React application
4. DevTools will automatically detect and connect to your running application

## üîí Production Safety

The React Query External Sync package is automatically disabled in production builds.

```jsx
// The package handles this internally:
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  useSyncQueries = require("./new-sync/useSyncQueries").useSyncQueries;
} else {
  // In production, this becomes a no-op function
  useSyncQueries = () => ({
    isConnected: false,
    connect: () => {},
    disconnect: () => {},
    socket: null,
    users: [],
  });
}
```

### üì± Using with Real Devices (Local Network)

When testing on real devices connected to your local network, you'll need to use your host machine's IP address instead of `localhost`. Here's a helpful setup for Expo apps (contributed by [ShoeBoom](https://github.com/ShoeBoom)):

```jsx
import Constants from "expo-constants";
import AsyncStorage from "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage";
import * as SecureStore from "expo-secure-store";
import { storage } from "./mmkv"; // Your MMKV instance

// Get the host IP address dynamically
const hostIP =
  Constants.expoGoConfig?.debuggerHost?.split(`:`)[0] ||
  Constants.expoConfig?.hostUri?.split(`:`)[0];

function AppContent() {
  useSyncQueriesExternal({
    queryClient,
    socketURL: `http://${hostIP}:42831`, // Use local network IP
    deviceName: Platform?.OS || "web",
    platform: Platform?.OS || "web",
    deviceId: Platform?.OS || "web",
    extraDeviceInfo: {
      appVersion: "1.0.0",
    },
    enableLogs: false,
    envVariables: {
      NODE_ENV: process.env.NODE_ENV,
    },
    // Storage monitoring
    mmkvStorage: storage,
    asyncStorage: AsyncStorage,
    secureStorage: SecureStore,
    secureStorageKeys: ["userToken", "refreshToken"],
  });

  return <YourApp />;
}
```

> **Note**: For optimal connection, launch DevTools before starting your application.

## üí° Usage Tips

- Keep DevTools running while developing
- Monitor query states in real-time
- View detailed query information
- Track cache updates and invalidations
- **Monitor device storage**: View and modify MMKV, AsyncStorage, and SecureStorage data in real-time
- **Track environment variables**: Monitor public environment variables across your application
- **Use storage queries**: Access storage data via React Query with keys like `['#storage', 'mmkv', 'key']`
- The hook is automatically disabled in production builds, no configuration needed

## üì± Platform Support

React Native DevTools works with **any React-based application**, regardless of platform:

- üì± Mobile: iOS, Android
- üñ•Ô∏è Web: React, Next.js, Remix, etc.
- üñ•Ô∏è Desktop: Electron, Tauri
- üì∫ TV: tvOS, Android TV
- ü•Ω VR/AR: Meta Quest, etc.
- üíª Cross-platform: Expo, React Native Web

If your platform can run React and connect to a socket server, it will work with these DevTools!

## üíæ Storage Monitoring

React Native DevTools now includes powerful storage monitoring capabilities with full CRUD operations:

### Supported Storage Types

- **MMKV**: High-performance key-value storage
- **AsyncStorage**: React Native's standard async storage
- **SecureStorage**: Secure storage for sensitive data (Expo SecureStore)

### Features

- **Real-time monitoring**: See storage changes as they happen
- **CRUD operations**: Create, read, update, and delete storage entries directly from DevTools
- **React Query integration**: Access storage data via queries like `['#storage', 'mmkv', 'keyName']`
- **Type-safe operations**: Automatic serialization/deserialization of complex data types
- **Secure data handling**: SecureStorage keys are monitored securely

### Usage Example

```jsx
// In your app, use React Query to interact with storage
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";

// Read from MMKV storage
const { data: userData } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["#storage", "mmkv", "user"],
  // Data will be automatically synced with DevTools
});

// Write to AsyncStorage
const queryClient = useQueryClient();
const updateAsyncStorage = useMutation({
  mutationFn: async ({ key, value }) => {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
    // Invalidate to trigger sync
    queryClient.invalidateQueries(["#storage", "async", key]);
  },
});
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

Having issues? Check these common solutions:

1. **App Not Connecting**

   - Ensure DevTools is launched before your React app
   - Check that your React app is running
   - Verify you're on the same network
   - Make sure the `socketURL` is correctly pointing to localhost:42831
   - Verify the Socket.IO client is properly installed in your app
   - Check that the `useSyncQueriesExternal` hook is properly implemented

2. **App Not Starting**

   - Verify you're using the latest version
   - Check system requirements (macOS with Apple Silicon chip)
   - Try reinstalling the application
   - If using an Intel Mac and encountering issues, please report them

3. **Socket Connection Issues**

   - Make sure no firewall is blocking the connection on port 42831
   - Restart both the DevTools app and your React app
   - Check the console logs with `enableLogs: true` for any error messages
   - If the React Query data is too large the socket connection will crash! If you see the device connect and then disconnect with no logs this is what's happening. You'll need to fix your query cache to not be so large.

4. **Data Not Syncing**

   - Confirm you're passing the correct `queryClient` instance
   - Set `enableLogs: true` to see connection information

5. **Android Real Device Connection Issues**

   - If using a real Android device with React Native CLI and ADB, ensure `isDevice: true`
   - The package transforms `localhost` to `10.0.2.2` for emulators only
   - Use `ExpoDevice.isDevice` for automatic detection: `import * as ExpoDevice from "expo-device"`
   - Check network connectivity between your device and development machine

6. **DevTools App Issues**

   - Make sure your `deviceId` is persistent (see below)
   - Verify you're using the latest version
   - Check system requirements (macOS with Apple Silicon chip)
   - Try reinstalling the application
   - If using an Intel Mac and encountering issues, please report them

7. **Storage Monitoring Issues**

   - Ensure storage instances are properly passed to the hook
   - For SecureStorage, make sure `secureStorageKeys` array is provided
   - Check that storage permissions are granted on the device
   - Verify storage libraries are properly installed and configured
   - Use `enableLogs: true` to see storage sync information

That's it! If you're still having issues, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LovesWorking/rn-better-dev-tools/issues) for support.

## üè∑Ô∏è Device Type Detection

The `isDevice` prop helps the DevTools distinguish between real devices and simulators/emulators. This is **crucial for Android connectivity** - the package automatically handles URL transformation for Android emulators (localhost ‚Üí 10.0.2.2) but needs to know if you're running on a real device to avoid this transformation.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Android Connection Issue

On real Android devices using React Native CLI and ADB, the automatic emulator detection can incorrectly transform `localhost` to `10.0.2.2`, breaking WebSocket connections. Setting `isDevice: true` prevents this transformation.

**Recommended approaches:**

```jsx
// Best approach using Expo Device (works with bare React Native too)
import * as ExpoDevice from "expo-device";

useSyncQueriesExternal({
  queryClient,
  socketURL: "http://localhost:42831",
  deviceName: Platform.OS,
  platform: Platform.OS,
  deviceId: Platform.OS,
  isDevice: ExpoDevice.isDevice, // Automatically detects real devices vs emulators
  // ... other props
});

// Alternative: Simple approach using React Native's __DEV__ flag
isDevice: !__DEV__, // true for production/real devices, false for development/simulators

// Alternative: More sophisticated detection using react-native-device-info
import DeviceInfo from 'react-native-device-info';
isDevice: !DeviceInfo.isEmulator(), // Automatically detects if running on emulator

// Manual control for specific scenarios
isDevice: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? !Platform.isPad : Platform.OS !== 'web',
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note About Device IDs

The `deviceId` parameter must be **persistent** across app restarts and re-renders. Using a value that changes (like `Date.now()`) will cause each render to be treated as a new device.

**Recommended approaches:**

```jsx
// Simple approach for single devices
deviceId: Platform.OS, // Works if you only have one device per platform

// Better approach for multiple simulators/devices of same type
// Using AsyncStorage, MMKV, or another storage solution
const [deviceId, setDeviceId] = useState(Platform.OS);

useEffect(() => {
  const loadOrCreateDeviceId = async () => {
    // Try to load existing ID
    const storedId = await AsyncStorage.getItem('deviceId');

    if (storedId) {
      setDeviceId(storedId);
    } else {
      // First launch - generate and store a persistent ID
      const newId = `${Platform.OS}-${Date.now()}`;
      await AsyncStorage.setItem('deviceId', newId);
      setDeviceId(newId);
    }
  };

  loadOrCreateDeviceId();
}, []);
```
